# Demo 

This repository contains MATLAB codes for different fluid dynamics tasks, each with its dedicated folder and accompanying report:

1. Blasius Equation
Numerical solution of the classical Blasius boundary layer equation for laminar flow over a flat plate.

2.2D Heat Flow
Simulation of two-dimensional heat conduction problems using MATLAB.

3.Lid Driven Cavity
Simulation of incompressible flow in a lid-driven cavity, a benchmark problem in computational fluid dynamics.

Each task is organised into its folder, containing the respective MATLAB code and a detailed report describing the methodology and results.
